fine techniques of programming 
course(UE17CS257D) taken by Prof. N.S Kumar.

# Course Content

1.
Memory Management – garbage, dangling pointer, dereferencing dangling pointer
- why it may not crash
Project: Develop memory manager – safe/unsafe efficient in space and/or time

2.
Bitwise wise
Store an int in bit – external sorting of unique integers using bits
binary counter
Project : find the second highest in n + log(n) – 2 comparisons with (log(n))^2 extra space

3.
Arrays : challenging problems and efficient programs
Project: defragmentation of blocks

4.
stepanov's binary counter
finding second biggest in n + logn - 2 comparisons
discussed:
kth biggest
k way merge using heap
why heap for a priority queue?
why is heapsort not preferred?
find min and max using divide and conquer
Project: sort a list in place using binary counter

5.
Trees: height balanced trees
Project : implement trees on the hard disk
Project : implement height balanced tree on the hard disk
